## Getting And Cleaning Data - Final Project

This is a code book describing the various files in this project, and documenting the format of averages.txt

### Files

  - runAnalysis.R - contains the logic for generating the tidy data from the data set.
  - general.R - some utility functions for using popd/pushd to enter/leave directories in a shell-like manner
  - averages.txt - file generated by runAnalysis which contains the tidy data result. See the section below for details.
  - README.rmd - this file, used to generate the README.md and run the runAnalysis.R script.
  
### Running
  Simply extract the [UCI HAR Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) into the working directory, install:
  
  - rmarkdown
  - data.tables
  - dplyr
  
  And knit the README.rmd file.

### Activites

```{r activites, echo=FALSE}
  for (name in activity_lbls$Activity){ cat(paste(name,'\r\n')) }
```

### Outputs

The output file (averages.txt) represents a summary of all subject/activity pairs, and their averages for various measurements which were taken. There are Gyroscope and Accelerometer readings with various levels of integration/derivation, e.g. for calculating Jerk, Acceleration, mean, standard deviation. Each of these readings has been averaged and put into the output file.

For example, Subject 3 has his WALKING activity summarized for the average of all his walking data.

The data is in a file called averages.txt with the following columns:

```{r codebook, echo=FALSE, results='markup'}
  idx <- 1
  for (name in names(merged_data)){ cat(paste(idx,name,'\r\n')); idx <- idx+1}
```

In the above table, all values *except* Activity and Subject are the aggregate mean of their values in the merged test/training sets.

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

###For each record it is provided:


- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

###The dataset includes the following files:


- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
